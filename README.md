# GraphAntidimension

This repository includes the source files for the models for the calculation of the antidimension in graphs. These files code, in Mosel 5.6.0, the models in the paper entitled "On the (k,l)-anonymity of networks via their k-metric antidimension" authored by:

-   Elena Fernández (elena.fernandez(at)uca.es)

-   Dorota Kuziak (dorota.kuziak(at)uca.es)

-   Manuel Munoz-Marquez (manuel.munoz(at)uca.es)

-   Ismael G. Yero (ismael.gonzalez(at)uca.es)

at Universidad de Cádiz (Spain).

The source model files for cylinders and toruses, include a graph generator, so no data file is needed.

The source model files for dense and sparse general graphs include a random graph generator. In this cases, a seed for the random generator could also be provided.
